# Ultranatural

**Ultranatural** is an online multiplayer shooter developed in **Unreal Engine**. This project was my first experience working with Unreal Engine and my first attempt at implementing multiplayer functionality. Despite the challenges, I was able to achieve a **satisfactory result**, even though clean code and structure were sometimes compromised due to the learning curve and technical hurdles.

Ultranatural is a **team-based online shooter** that utilizes the **Steam plugin** for matchmaking and networking. The game features:

- **up to 16 vs. 16 Team Deathmatch Mode**
- **Multiplayer functionality using Unreal's networking system**
- **Blueprint-based development** for rapid prototyping
- **Unique environments and character designs**

## What I Learned

This project was a huge learning opportunity, particularly in:

- Understanding **multiplayer networking** in Unreal Engine
- Implementing **online matchmaking** using the **Steam plugin**
- Managing **Blueprint scripting** for gameplay mechanics
- Overcoming the challenges of learning **a new engine from scratch**
